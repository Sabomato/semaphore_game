# semaphore_game
This project is an implementation of the traditional game "Semaphore", in C language, with a object oriented approach.

In the original version, there is only green, yellow and red pieces. In this version, it was added a rock piece, that blocks the row, column and diagonal where it was placed, meaning the players can't win in those directions.
Each player can also increment the board twice per game, horizontally or vertically; save the state of the game (in a binary file, containing information about the players and the current/previous board states), and a succession of states of the board in each turn.
